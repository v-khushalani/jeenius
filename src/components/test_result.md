Perfect! The mock payment endpoint is working. Now let me update the test_result.md file to document what we've done:
Action: file_editor str_replace /app/test_result.md --old-str "#====================================================================================================
# Testing Data - Main Agent and testing sub agent both should log testing data below this section
#====================================================================================================" --new-str "#====================================================================================================
# Testing Data - Main Agent and testing sub agent both should log testing data below this section

  Fix freemium mode issues:
  1. Subscriptions not visible
  2. Chapters not locked properly
  3. Payment gateway integration needed (Razorpay mock)
  4. Connect all disconnected components

          Created backend endpoints for Razorpay mock payments:
          - /api/subscriptions/create-order (creates mock order)
          - /api/subscriptions/verify-payment (verifies mock payment and creates subscription)
          Tested with curl - working correctly. Returns order_id and processes payments.

          Backend stores subscriptions in MongoDB after payment verification.
          Subscription includes: user_id, plan_id, status, start_date, end_date, payment details.

          Updated freemium limits to user requirements:
          - 5 free chapters (across all subjects)
          - 25 questions per day (down from 50)
          - 0 AI queries (disabled for free users)
          Needs testing to verify limits are enforced correctly.

          Updated loadChapters function to:
          - Check subscription status from Supabase
          - Track accessed chapters in user_content_access table
          - Lock chapters after 5 free chapters accessed (across all subjects)
          - Display lock UI with \"Upgrade to Premium\" button
          Added chapter access tracking when user opens a chapter.
          Needs testing with actual user flow.

          Modified FloatingAIButton to check canUseAI() before showing.
          With 0 AI query limit, button should be hidden for free users.
          Only premium subscribers should see AI button.
          Needs testing to verify AI is disabled for free users.

          - Added \"Upgrade to Premium\" link in Header dropdown menu
          - Subscription plans page accessible at /subscription-plans
          - Paywall components link to subscription plans

          Mock Razorpay payment flow already exists:
          - initializePayment() calls backend create-order endpoint
          - Shows mock payment processing
          - Calls backend verify-payment endpoint
          - Should create subscription in MongoDB (via backend)
          - Redirects to dashboard on success
          Note: Backend endpoints now exist and working. Need to test full flow from frontend.

      Implementation complete. Key changes:
      
      **Backend:**
      1. Created mock payment endpoints (/api/subscriptions/create-order, /api/subscriptions/verify-payment)
      2. Backend stores subscriptions in MongoDB after payment
      
      **Frontend:**
      1. Updated freemium limits (5 chapters, 25 questions/day, 0 AI queries)
      2. Fixed chapter locking to track across all subjects
      3. Added chapter access tracking
      4. Disabled AI button for free users (canUseAI check)
      5. Added \"Upgrade to Premium\" link in Header
      6. Payment flow connects to backend endpoints
      
      **Ready for Testing:**
      - Need to verify chapter locking works correctly
      - Test payment flow creates subscriptions
      - Verify AI is hidden for free users
      - Test subscription plans page accessibility
      
      **Note:** Supabase tables required:
      - subscriptions (user_id, plan_id, status, start_date, end_date)
      - user_content_access (user_id, content_type, content_identifier, subject, accessed_at)
      - free_content_limits (limit_type, limit_value)
      
      These tables may need to be created/initialized in Supabase."
